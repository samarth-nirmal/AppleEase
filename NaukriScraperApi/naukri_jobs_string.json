        "Description": "The role of a Software Engineer has evolved with Generative AI (GenAI) and AI-assisted development tools (Cursor, Replit, Loveable, GitHub Copilot). This position focuses on leveraging AI to build, iterate, and refine software solutions, with a greater emphasis on problem-solving, logical thinking, and continuous improvement rather than deep technical specialism.\nRather than just writing code, the AI-Augmented Engineer operates AI-powered workflows, experiments rapidly, and integrates solutions that align with customer needs. The ideal candidate will have a strong analytical mindset, a passion for learning, and an ability to work iteratively, rather than requiring deep expertise in traditional software engineering.We believe that for this role to be successful, you're someone who naturally thinks systematically and logically.\nYou dont need so much specific technical expertise, as much as having this instinctive behaviour. you'll be someone who sees inefficiencies, identifies what inputs would need to be improved or changed to eliminate the inefficiency. you'll be hungry to implement things, but know that its likely that tuning existing systems and processes will yield better, more sustainable results than adding more layers of code.\n \nKey Responsibilities\n \nAI-Augmented Development\nUse AI-powered development tools to write, review, and refine code efficiently.\nWork iteratively with AI to debug, refactor, and optimise existing solutions.\nExperiment with prompt engineering techniques to maximise AI-generated solutions.\nIdentify edge cases and risks in AI-generated code and implement solutions accordingly.\nProblem Solving & Logical Thinking\nBreak down complex challenges into smaller, testable components that can be addressed through AI-driven development.\nApply logical reasoning to verify AI-generated outputs, ensuring correctness and maintainability.\nUse data-driven insights to refine AI-assisted software development approaches.\nProactively explore alternative approaches and continuous improvements through iteration.\nIterative Development & Experimentation\nAdopt a rapid prototyping mindset, testing multiple AI-generated approaches and refining based on results.\nQuickly assess whether AI-assisted solutions meet the required outcomes, adjusting as necessary.\nLeverage AI for automated testing, performance improvements, and quality assurance.\nStay open to exploring new AI-powered workflows, balancing efficiency with reliability.\nCustomer-Focused Engineering\nDevelop solutions with a strong emphasis on end-user needs and experience.\nValidate AI-generated code against customer or business objectives, ensuring alignment.\nLeverage AI insights to identify patterns in user behaviour and inform development decisions.\nWork closely with cross-functional teams to continuously refine and improve products.\nContinuous Learning & AI Optimisation\nStay curious and experiment with new AI-assisted development tools.\nContinuously refine prompt engineering skills to maximise AI-generated code efficiency.\nShare learnings and collaborate with peers on best practices for AI-augmented development.\nChallenge existing assumptions and explore innovative AI-driven approaches to problem-solving.\nWe Would Love to Talk to You If...\nYou are naturally curious and love solving problems, regardless of prior technical experience.\nYou enjoy breaking down complex challenges into structured, logical steps.\nYou are excited by AI s potential in software development and eager to experiment with new AI tools.\nYou work iteratively, continuously refining your approach based on feedback and experimentation.\nYou are comfortable with ambiguity and learning as you go, rather than needing a perfect solution upfront.\nYou care about building solutions that truly help customers and are willing to adapt based on insights.\nYou value data-driven decision-making and use evidence to guide your iterations.\nYou see AI as a powerful assistant, helping you work more efficiently rather than replacing human problem-solving.\nWhy This Role?\nAI-First Development : Work with cutting-edge AI tools to create and refine software faster than ever before.\nProblem-Solving Over Coding : Focus on structuring logic, iterating, and improving outcomes, rather than deep technical specialisation.\nCustomer Impact : Use AI to rapidly prototype, validate, and deliver software solutions that matter.\nCareer Growth : Develop AI-driven workflows and automation skills that are shaping the future of software development.\nFuture-Proof Your Skills : Build expertise in AI-assisted problem-solving, logical reasoning, and iterative development.\nIdeal Candidate Profile Who should apply?\nIndividuals with a strong analytical mindset who enjoy solving problems, structuring logic, and iterating on ideas.\nThose who are curious and adaptable, excited to work alongside AI tools rather than relying solely on traditional approaches.\nPeople who thrive on learning new technologies and refining their workflows to improve efficiency.\nEngineers, analysts, or problem-solvers who enjoy using AI to enhance their decision-making and development speed.\nWho is this role NOT for?\nCandidates looking for a traditional software engineering role focused on deep technical specialism.\nIndividuals who prefer manual coding over AI-assisted workflows.\nThose who are resistant to rapid iteration, experimentation, and finding new ways of achieving great customer outcomes."
